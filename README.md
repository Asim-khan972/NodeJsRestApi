# NodeJsRestApi
A REST API (Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and conventions for building and interacting with web services. It is based on the principles of the HTTP protocol and allows different software applications to communicate and exchange data over the internet. REST APIs use HTTP methods (such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to perform operations on resources (data entities) and return responses in various formats like JSON or XML.

Building a Social Media Backend REST API with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB is a common real-world project that involves creating the backend infrastructure for a social media platform. This backend will handle user registration, authentication, creating and fetching posts, managing comments, and more. Below is a high-level overview of how you can approach building this project:

1. **Setup Project:**
   - Create a new Node.js project.
   - Install required dependencies: Express, Mongoose (for MongoDB interaction), body-parser (to parse incoming JSON), etc.

2. **Database Configuration:**
   - Set up a MongoDB database and connect your Node.js app to it using Mongoose.
   
3. **User Authentication:**
   - Create routes for user registration and login using Express.
   - Use bcrypt to hash and store passwords securely.
   - Generate JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for user authentication.

4. **User Management:**
   - Create routes for updating user profiles, changing passwords, etc.
   - Implement authorization checks to ensure users can only modify their own profiles.

5. **Post Management:**
   - Design routes for creating, updating, and deleting posts.
   - Implement CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for posts.
   - Associate posts with users using their unique IDs.

6. **Comment System:**
   - Create routes for adding, updating, and deleting comments on posts.
   - Store comments as separate entities in the database and associate them with posts.

7. **Like and Dislike System:**
   - Implement routes for users to like and dislike posts.
   - Update the post schema to keep track of likes and dislikes.

8. **Following and Followers:**
   - Create routes to allow users to follow and unfollow other users.
   - Design database schemas to track user relationships.

9. **Feed and Timeline:**
   - Implement routes to fetch a user's feed and timeline based on their followers and posts.
   - Combine and sort posts to display them in a chronological order.

10. **Pagination and Error Handling:**
    - Implement pagination for fetching large sets of data (posts, comments, etc.).
    - Set up error handling middleware to catch and handle different types of errors.

11. **Deployment:**
    - Deploy your Node.js app to a hosting service like Heroku, AWS, or Azure.
    - Set up environment variables for sensitive information (database URL, JWT secret, etc.).

Remember that this is a high-level overview, and building a complete social media backend REST API is a complex project that requires careful planning, architecture design, and attention to security. It's also recommended to follow best practices for API design, security, and performance optimization during the development process. You can find many tutorials and resources online that provide step-by-step guidance on building such projects.
